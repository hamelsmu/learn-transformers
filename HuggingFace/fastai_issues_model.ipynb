       "(#2) [{'body': \"Currently there is a bug where if you run `lr_find()` twice in a row, you will get very different results such as below: \\r\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7831895/96666881-f7f9e800-1325-11eb-858a-9eae1ae82b12.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sort of pattern is common in models that already have trained weights. Since we know that the models weights are stored away, my investigation led me to believe that something would be wrong with how we are loading in the optimizer in `learn.load`. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe stem of the issue is the fact that if `self.opt` is none we call `create_opt` and then pass this *new* opt into `load_model` as seen below:\\r\\n```python\\r\\ndef load(self, file, with_opt=None, device=None, **kwargs):\\r\\n        if device is None and hasattr(self.dls, 'device'): device = self.dls.device\\r\\n        if self.opt is None: self.create_opt()\\r\\n        file = join_path_file(file, self.path/self.model_dir, ext='.pth')\\r\\n        load_model(file, self.model, self.opt, device=device, **kwargs)\\r\\n        return self\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat winds up happening is the same optimizer state is being used, despite us trying to load in new weights because `self.opt` is not `None` when it goes in. The proposed fix is that if `with_opt` is `None`, we set `self.opt` to `None`. This allows for a much better graph that we could expect:\\r\\n```python\\r\\n@patch\\r\\ndef load(self:Learner, file, with_opt=None, device=None, **kwargs):\\r\\n    if device is None and hasattr(self.dls, 'device'): device = self.dls.device\\r\\n    if with_opt is None: self.opt=None\\r\\n    file = join_path_file(file, self.path/self.model_dir, ext='.pth')\\r\\n    load_model(file, self.model, self.opt, device=device, **kwargs)\\r\\n    return self\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7831895/96667077-5b841580-1326-11eb-856a-c35537a094c6.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me know if this fix looks okay to you @jph00, or if you believe there is a better solution for addressing the issue \\r\\n\", 'title': 'Learn.load and LRFinder not functioning properly for the optimizer states'},{'body': 'following the [conversation](https://forums.fast.ai/t/fbeta-formula-for-averages-references-non-existing-metric/40965) on the dev forum:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever the precision does not go over all the classes it returns `nan`s in some of it\\'s elements, hence the end `*` and `sum()` result in the overall `nan`:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/bc093a9de9c9d6c3d2c7e5ad6d7a427face1ca9a/fastai/metrics.py#L215\\r\\n\\r\\nThis happens in the beginning of training.

While browsing the code for Trainer, it appears that the attribute `is_in_train` is set to True and then later set to False at the end of training, but I am not 100% sure. \n",

It seems that the defaults for `Seq2SeqTrainingArguments` are not model-specific, but perhaps there is a way to get this?  \n",

    "- Why is `model` passed into DataCollatorForSeq2Seq?  I can see from the code that it is using the model's `prepare_decoder_input_ids_from_labels` attribute, but isn't that something that would/should also be available in a tokenizer instead?  I'm just trying to build a better mental model of what is happening.  \n",

Like is there a way I can leverage some of the same machinery you have so I don't have to create my own inference machinery?  I know I can create it myself, but wondering if there is a way to avoid having to build a thing that takes strings, tokenizes, numericalizes, does a forward pass, then decodes that back into a string with beam search etc. "
